# Introduction-to-PYTHON
All about an introductory content about Python👩🏻‍💻.
Here is an excellent university-level self-study course for #Python beginners along with exercises to try & learn by doing!!

few tips for Learners:

1) Have patience, if you are a beginner it will take time to let things sink in.

2) Aim at building small tools/projects, don’t just learn the syntax and jump to a new programming language.

3) Frustration and pain is a part of learning process, embrace it instead of avoiding it.

4) Errors/ issues are expected, don’t let that discourage you from learning.

5) Be consistent, if you are not consistent in learning it might take a lot more time and effort.

& always remember that the best way to learn any programming language is keep practicing,
Happy learning!
